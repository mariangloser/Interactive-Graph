# Interactive-Graph
Interactive graph simulation with shortest path function. This is a short project aimed at practising my simple graph skills combined with interactivity for more difficulty and fun. The simulation needs a pygame package. Upon start a blank window will appear. To create vertices of a graph, use left click. The vertices can then be connected pressing the left mouse button and dragging. After completing a graph, right clicking on any two vertices will visualize the shortest path between the two vertices if possible (using BFS in the implementation).
